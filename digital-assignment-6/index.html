<h2>Side Hero!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The idea and genre behind the game is original. Side Hero is a mix between a side-scroller and a role-playing game. Although this prototype does not have all of the aspects
that would be in the final version, the idea is still original. I have not played a side-scrolling RPG before either, so the genre, or mix of genres, are original as
well.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game has some technical merit that I have not explored before. First, the game uses animations for the player and the enemies. Specifically, the player's character
has animations that interact when different inputs are given and end up interacting with each other. For instance, the player's character attacks when the mouse is
clicked which causes a different animation to happen different than that of the animation that happens when the character is moving. Furthermore, I integrated a health
tracking system in the game which keeps track of the player's health and the enemies health (under the hood). In this prototype, combat is initialized by the player in
which if a player is close enough to an enemy and clicks to attack, then a single "round" of combat takes place between the player and the enemy. In addition, multiple
forms of input are accepted by the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned about some new aspects of Phaser and laid the groundwork in this prototype for further Phaser exploration when I iterate on this prototype. For example, I
learned more about Phaser animations and how they interact with each other. It is quite difficult to have a large array of animations occur on a single token,
especially when the animations change based on input. In addition, I implemented a "health tracker" in the game for the player and the enemies which I had not done
before, so it was interesting to think about and implement that into the game as I can now build off of that to perhaps change it to a class-like structure and build
more into making a class that defines the entire character and everything associated with them. The easiest part of making the game was defining the general digital
structure of the game since I had already made an analog game that related to this digital assignment. The hardest part of creating the game was dealing with the
different animations of the player character since they interacted and changed frequently. In addition, it was also difficult to think about how to keep track of
enemies, the player, and their attributes. Furthermore, it was difficult to learn all of the required Phaser aspects that were applicable to this game.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are an ambitious adventurer hoping to become the next Side Hero! Will you be able to defeat the enemies and the boss in order to prevail and gain the title!?
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This game does not use a Storymatic theme that was provided since they were optional for this assignment.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The input that this game utilzies is direct with a couple of indirect input aspects. The player directly controls their character and what they do. However, the player's
input impacts the game because it may get rid of enemies if they are defeated. The game is deterministic in that the outcome is largely deterministic. There is a
small amount of randomness because the damage done in the game is determined randomly. However, I hope to include some more aspects of randomness in the next iteration
such as the position and number of enemies. The genre of the game is both Side-Scroller and Role-Playing Game (RPG). The play styles that relate to this game are "The
Explorer," and the "The Achiever." "The Explorer" relates because the player can explore the map and "The Achiever" relates because the player can win the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic that the prototype is evaluating is various animations interacting on a token at the same time as well as a side-scrolling map being present which
restricts movement and the scope of the map.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope that the players have a fun experience in which they are determined to complete the game and win it. Although the game is simple, I still hope that the player
experience is fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay starts by spawning the player character on the side-scrolling map. The goal of the game is to survive a journey through the map and then defeat the boss.
The player is able to use the arrow keys and WASD to move the character side by side. In addition, the player can use the up arrow key to jump. When the player clicks,
they attack. When the player character is close enough to an enemy and attacks, a "round" of combat occurs in which the player does damage first and then the enemy
does damage if they were not defeated. If a player's health drops to zero or lower, they lose the game. If the player defeats the boss, then they win the game and gain
the title of "Side Hero!" Some aspects of gameplay that are not in this prototype, but that I hope to include in the future iteration, include random enemy creation,
ranged weapon attacks, physics that allow the player to jump and land on certain blocks, different scenes that provide turn-based combat, and powerups that the player
can pick up and store in an inventory for future use.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect the player to use a couple of different strategies. I plan to add more dynamic and automatic conflict into the game in the later iteration, but one strategy
would be to ignore all of the smaller enemies and go straight for the boss. Another strategy I think players will use is to avoid combat if the character's health gets
low.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in a fantasy-like, simple world in which the player is hoping to end the undead scourge that has plagued the land. Doing so grants them the title of
"Side Hero." The goal of the game is to defeat the largest, most powerful undead creature in order to end the plague of undead in the land. The player character is 
interesting in that there are many actions that the player can take that directly impact what the player character is doing or appears to be doing. The enemies in the
game are interesting because they can actually hurt the player character and take health away. This adds a level of challenge and interactivity in the game and the
conflict that occurs in the game. The player token represents the player character and protagonist in the game. The mummy token represents the enemies and undead
creatures that are infecting the land. The backstory is that the player is an adventurer and aspiring hero who seeks to end the undead scourge on the land. They have
travelled to the center of the undead territory to defeat the largest and most powerful undead leader or boss. The dramatic tension of the game connects to the gameplay
tension of the game in that the player character is trying to survive and defeat the boss, but also encounters smaller enemies that can hinder their progress. As a result,
the player's dramatic, over-arching goal can be stopped short if they are not careful with the gameplay choices they make while creating the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is anyone who enjoys a simple side-scroller, but will also appeal to those who enjoy role-playing games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The play time of the game varies slightly, but usually takes about one or two minutes to play.
